# üéí Graphics starter
> A stater kit for building responsive D3 charts

This is a framework for creating and deploying responsive D3 graphics, built using Grunt. 

Key features:
- üç™ Produce quick-turn cookie-cutter D3 charts with templates.
- üé® Support for compiling SASS.
- üì± Embed charts in IFrames responsively, with Pym.js.

## Installation

First, install Node:

```
brew install node
```

Clone this repository, and install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next, install Grunt to be able to create, test and build graphics:

```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Create a project

To create a new project, run:

```
grunt create --slug=name_of_project --template=template_here
```

This generator, currently accepts the following chart templates: 
- simple-bar
- stacked-bar
- compare-bar
- line

Once the `grunt create` command is run, a new directory within the `projects` directory will be created, named after the `slug` parameter. For instance, if you run the command `grunt create --slug=gas-prices --template=line`, a directory named `gas-prices` will be created in the `projects` directory, with the line chart template.

## Test a project

To run a live server to develop a graphic, run:

```
grunt serve --slug=name_of_project
```

Visit <a href="http://localhost:8000/">`http://localhost:8000/`</a> to preview the graphic.

## Build a project

To build out a graphic, run:

```
grunt build --slug=name_of_project
```

This will create a new directory with the name of the project within in `production` directory with all the necessary (minified and uglified) files.

## Push and deploy a project

Push the build to GitHub, where the build will be deployed to GitHub pages. 

Add the changes: 

```
git add --all
```

Commit the changes:

```
git commit -m "message_here"
```

Push the changes:

```
git push origin main
```

Wait for a minute or two, and then visit the following URL to view the project:

```
<username>.github.io/graphics-starter/production/<name_of_the_project>
```

## Adding a project as an IFrame:
This generator uses [Pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/) from the NPR visuals team to resize IFrames responsively.

To embed a project, add the following code to an HTML file:
```
<div id="_name_of_the_project_"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">var pymParent = new pym.Parent('_name_of_the_project_','https://<username>.github.io/graphics-starter/production/<name_of_the_project>', {});</script>
</div>
```
